STEP 1 -- UNDERSTAND TECHNICAL ANALYSIS BASICS
The document provides a comprehensive overview of technical analysis (TA) in stock trading. All known and unknown information is reflected in market prices, price moves in trends, and history tends to repeat itself due to consistent human behavior in markets. Key data include open, high, low, close, and volume. Closing price is crucial as it signals market sentiment and potential future direction.

Chart types like line, bar, and candlestick help visualize price data. Candlestick patterns like Marubozu, Hammer, Hanging Man, Spinning Top, Doji, Engulfing, Harami, Morning/Evening Star, and Shooting Star signal market sentiment shifts. Each pattern has specific implications for traders depending on context and prior trends. Spinning tops and Dojis often indicate indecision, while Hammers and Bullish Engulfing patterns suggest reversals.

Support and resistance (S&R) levels are essential for setting targets and stop-losses. Drawing effective S&R requires identifying consistent price action zones across time. Volume plays a crucial role; above-average volume confirms price action strength, while low volume suggests weak conviction.

Moving averages (SMA and EMA) smooth price data and are key in identifying trends. Crossover systems (e.g., 9-21 EMA) signal entries and exits. Moving Averages work best in trending markets and can produce many signals in sideways markets.

Indicators like RSI and MACD assist in identifying overbought/oversold conditions and momentum shifts. Bollinger Bands help assess volatility and potential reversals in sideways markets. The checklist approach ensures disciplineâ€”trades must align with candlestick patterns, S&R, volume, and indicators.

Lastly, Fibonacci retracement helps identify potential pullback levels for entries. When these retracement levels align with S&R and patterns, they signal high-probability setups. The document concludes by referencing Dow Theory as foundational to understanding market phases and trends.
